# 365-commits
I just created this repo to document my goal of coding and pushing commits every day in 2026.

In 2025, I achieved one of my main goals: coding every day, or at least almost every day. For 2026, I don’t want to set a lot of goals for coding — maybe the only great goal is to code every day, even on bad days.

### Rules
- I need to push code every day.
- Just creating issues doesn’t count.
- I need to learn something about code and push it
- In bad days, push even if it's just one commit


Start on January 1 and end on December 31.
